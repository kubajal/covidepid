# The *covidepid* ontology

This repository contains the [*covidepid*](covidepid.owl) ontology along with four external ontologies that the [*covidepid*](covidepid.owl) ontology integrates into a single domain data model:

 1. [Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical Classification (ATC) by World Health Organization, v2021aa](https://bioportal.bioontology.org/ontologies/ATC)
 2. [International Classification of Diseases, Version 10 - Clinical Modification (ICD10CM) by World Health Organization, v2021aa](https://bioportal.bioontology.org/ontologies/ICD10CM)
 3. [*Friend of a Friend* (FOAF) by Dan Brickley and Libby Miller](http://xmlns.com/foaf/spec/)
 4. [*FOAF Relationship* - an extension of FOAF by Ian Davis](https://vocab.org/relationship/)

The four external ontologies are uploaded here in case they get removed from their original sources on the Internet. I do not claim rights to them and I want hereby to credit their authors as indicated in their coresponding entries in the list above.
